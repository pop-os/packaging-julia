# Rust Packaging

Packaging of newer versions of Rust for Pop!\_OS, using the official GPG-signed tarball releases from [rust-lang.org](https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html). Tarballs are fetched during build and their SHA256 sum is compared to checksums in this repository to verify them.
